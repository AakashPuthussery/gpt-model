# Flask GPT Model Integration

This project demonstrates how to deploy a GPT model from Hugging Face as a Flask application on your local machine. The application provides an API endpoint to interact with the model, allowing users to generate responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Transformers library from Hugging Face

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_gpt_project.git
cd flask_gpt_project

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install Flask transformers

### Step 4: Run the Flask Application
python app.py
The Flask server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

This `README.md` file provides clear instructions for setting up and running your Flask application, including creating the necessary files and dependencies, testing the application, and optimizing performance.
